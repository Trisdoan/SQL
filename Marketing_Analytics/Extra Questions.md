# Questions from marketing team


## 1. Which film title was the most recommended for all customers?

### Steps:
- Use **INNER JOIN** to merge ```rental```, ```inventory``` ,```film```,```film_category```and```category```.
- **INNER JOIN** and **LEFT JOIN** are them same. I did some tests to see whether there is a difference, which shows below.


````sql
with cte as
(Select 
    title
From category_recommendations
UNION ALL
Select 
    title
From actor_recommendations
)
  Select
      title,
      COUNT( title) as reco_count
  FROM cte
  GROUP BY title
ORDER BY reco_count DESC;
);
````
   
| customer_id | total_sales |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |

| customer_id | total_sales |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
